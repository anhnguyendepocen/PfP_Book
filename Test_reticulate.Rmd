# Test Python chunks in Rmarkdown

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

```{r}
print("R chunk")
```


```{python}
import sys
print(sys.version)
```

```{python}
# Do separate chunks use the same Python session?
a = 1
```

```{python}
# If this prints correctly, they do.
print(a)
```

```{r}
# Python variables can also be accessed form R

print(py$a)
```


```{python eval = F}
# unevaluated chunk
print("You should not see output from this")
```


```{python eval = F}
# unevaluated chunk with error
print(1.0/0)
```



```{}
""This is syntactically invalid, but should not give an error message"
""Because it is syntactically invalid, it also cannot be parsed and highlighted""Â´
