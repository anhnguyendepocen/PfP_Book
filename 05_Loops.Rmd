```

Very much unlike human beings, computers are good at executing repetitive tasks without making errors. It just so happens that boring, repetitive tasks are an inescapable part of many exciting things. Take psychological research as an example. In conducting psychological research, you may come up with a theory about human beings, about how things work between humans, or maybe between a human operator and a machine. Or, alternatively, you may have a research question, a question about how things work, how human beings function, why they make the mistakes they make. Now, what do psychologists do to find an answer to their scientific questions? Right, psychologists conduct empirical research. 

Let's say, you have a research question and you try to answer your question by setting up an empirical experiment. You invite others to participate in your research. You repeat your experimental procedure with each and every participant. Depending on the kind of research you conducted, you repeat the qualitative inspection of the generated data for each participant. And depending on the statistical tool you use, you may end up filling in the data of each and every participant by hand into your statistical software. Now, here is the good news. Programming can help you unbore (yes, that is a word) the boring and repetitive bits of your exciting research.

At the root of boring tasks often lies repetition. You repeat an experimental procedure, you repeat the same quality checks for the data of each participant, you perform the same data cleaning on each single row in a data frame, and so on. Human beings tend to make mistakes when they repeat the same task over and over again. At the same time, this is exactly where the strength of computers lies. Computers do not make mistakes when they repeat a task. When a computer makes a mistake, then it is because it was falsely instructed in the first place.

Chapter 5 introduces you to the mechanism that lies at the heart of a computer's paramount strength, repetition; or as it is called in computer jargon: *loops*. The Python language has a number of features that make it easier for you as a programmer to make your computer execute those boring, repetitive tasks for you.

## The `for` loop

```{python}
for letter in "Hello":
    print(letter)
```

The `for` loop is one possibility to create repetition in a computer program. In computer science, the repeated execution of a set of statements is called *iteration*. The `for` loop *iterates* over a *sequence* of objects. Remember from chapter 4 Lists, that *lists* and *strings* are both sequences. They are *ordered* collections of elements, where strings are sequences of characters and lists can contain any kind of object. So what does it mean for the `for` loop to iterate over a sequence? It means that it visits each element in the sequence one by one, in an ordered fashion. 

Regarding the syntax of `for` loops; a `for` loop begins with the `for` keyword, followed by the so-called *loop variable*. In the example above, the variable `letter` serves as the loop variable. The `in` keyword, which you encountered in chapter 4 follows on the loop variable. Then a *sequence* which can (amongst other things) be a list or a string is included. Finally, a colon `:` demarcates the end of the `for` statement. Semantically, the `for` statement in the above example says nothing else but

> For each letter that exists in the word "Hello"

On each iteration of the `for` loop, the *loop variable* takes on the value of the next element in the sequence. This means that on the first iteration, the loop variable `letter` has the value `H`, on the second iteration, it has the value `e`, on the third iteration, its value is `l`, and so on. The loop variable ceases to take on a new value once it is assigned the last element of the designated sequence, in this case the`o` of `"Hello"`.

Syntactically, after the `for` statement, the so-called *loop body* follows. The body of a loop specifies the statements that are to be executed on each iteration. In the example above, printing the current value of the loop variable `letter` is executed on each iteration of the loop.

The body of a loop needs to be *indented*. The end of a `for` loop is demarcated by indentation. Once the value of the last element in the sequence has been assigned to the loop variable, and the body of the loop has been executed, the loop terminates. The execution of the computer program is continued on the first line after the loop body, and indentation (or rather the lack thereof) demarcates this line, like so

```{python, eval=F}
for letter in "Hello":
    print(letter)

print("World")
```

Here, `print("Hello")` constitutes the first line after the `for` loop.

Instead of including a manually defined sequence in the `for` statement, such as the string `"Hello"`, you can use the `range` method to create a list of integers. For example, you may want to repeat a certain block of statements twice. However, the block of statements may not involve a suitable sequence over which you can make a `for` loop iterate. In such cases, you can use the `range` method to create a looping mechanism, like so

```{python}
for i in range(2):
    print("Hello, World!")
```

Unless specified otherwise, the `range` method initiates a list that contains each integer starting at `0` until, but excluding the specified integer between the brackets `()`.

```{python}
print(range(2))
```

In the example above, the loop variable `i` will thus have two values before the loop terminates, `0` and `1`. In total, the statement `print("Hello, World")` is therefore executed twice.

Read the documentation of the `range` method for further information on how to customize the sequence of integers it produces.

```{python, eval=F}
help(range)
```

In summary, from the above it follows that there are at least two ways for iterating over *ordered* sequences of objects, such as lists and strings, using `for` loops. In the first strategy, you assign each element of the sequence iteratively to the loop variable, like so

```{python}
a = ['a', 'b']
for i in a:
    print(i)
```

Following the second strategy, you access the elements of the sequence through their indices, like so

```{python}
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i])
```

Which way of iterating over *ordered* sequences you prefer is up to you. Sometimes, the problem you try to solve with your code will require one way, sometimes the other. However, when constructing loops, remember that you **cannot** access the elements of an *unordered* collection such as dictionaries using the index operator.

```{python error = TRUE}
d = {'a': 1,
     'b': 2}
for i in range(len(d)):
    print(d[i])
```

You will need to think of another way to iterate over the contents of a dictionary. You could use the `keys()` method to iterate over the dictionary's keys, or the `values()` method for its values respectively, like so

```{python}
for i in d.keys():
  print(i)
  
for j in d.values():
  print(j)
```

Alternatively, the `items()` method can be used to iterate over the key-value pairs contained in a dictionary.

```{python}
for z in d.items():
  print(z)
```

As usual, which iteration strategy you use depends on what you try to achieve. There is not one golden solution that fits all problems.

## The `while` loop

```{python}
a = 0
b = 1

while b < 5:
    a += b
    b += b
    print("Current sum is:", a, "current value is:", b)

print("This is the first line of code after the loop, the sum is:", a)
    
```

A `while` loop is centered around a condition formulated in the first line of the loop, the `while` statement. It allows you to repeatedly execute a number of body statements as long as the condition in the `while` statement remains `True`. At the same time, this means that the body of a `while` loop is never executed if the loop condition is `False` at its initial execution.

```{python}
a = 0
b = 5

while b < 5:
    a += b
    b += b
    print("Current sum is:", a, "current value is:", b)

print("This is the first line of code after the loop, the sum is:", a)
```

The strategy behind `while` loops is that the body of the loop changes one or more (loop) variables so that the loop condition eventually becomes `False`. Otherwise, the loop will continue forever and we speak of an *infinte loop*. Infinite loops can manoeuver your program into a dead end if started unintentionally.

Note how the basic structure of the Stroop Task program is a large while loop. Unless the required number of trials has been executed, the program will keep running.

### `for` or `while`?

At times, it may be confusing whether either a `for` or a `while` loop will suit your needs best. If you are unsure which kind of loop you should use, ask yourself the following:

* Do I know in advance how many times I need the loop body to be executed? Problems like "searching a collection for a specified element" or "executing code a specified number of times" suggest that a `for` loop will suit your needs best.
* Do I require the computations to stop when some condition is met, but I cannot tell in advance when (or if) this will happen? Chances are high that a `while` loop will fit your needs best in this case.

Still, a programmer has a certain freedom in choosing either *for* or *while* loops for their purposes. In many cases, using either kind of loop is but a difference of perspective on the problem you try to solve with your code.


## The `break` statement

```{python, eval=F}
myNumber = 17
while True:
    guess = input("Enter a number:")
    if guess > 17:
        print("My number is smaller than", guess)
    elif guess < 17:
        print("My number is larger than", guess)
    else:
        break
print("Ding! Ding! You guessed correctly, my number is", myNumber)
```

The `break` statement allows you to immediately exit any loop, be it a `for` or a `while` loop. The next statement that is executed is the first after the loop body. Interactive programs that process user input often require to exit their loops prematurely. Depending on the input given, the program may need to transition to the next state or terminate altogether.

## Control flow

By now you will have noticed that by default, Python faithfully executes any program in a top-down order. But what if you want to change the order in which specific parts of your program are being executed, possibly depending on external conditions such as the time of the day, or user input?

Yes, you may have guessed it already, this is achieved by using *control flow statements*. Python knows three control flow statements: : `if`,`for`, and `while`statements. We already encountered `if` statements in Chapter 3 [Conditionals]. Control flow statements are readily used in interactive software such as the Stroop experiment

```{python, eval=F}
STATE = "welcome"
while True:

    # Changing states by user input
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if STATE == "welcome":
            if event.type == KEYDOWN and event.key == K_SPACE:
                STATE = "prepare_next_trial"
                print(STATE)
        
        if event.type == QUIT:
                STATE = "quit"
```

In principle, the above code can run infinitely, unless the user triggers the `QUIT` `event.type`. Note that in the original Stroop experiment, there is another condition that prevents the program from running infinitely, namely a maximum number of trials.

Within the main `while` loop, a `for`loop manages the changing of program states as a consequence of user input. To this end, the loop variable `event` iterates over *event objects* stored in an *event queue*, which is essentially a special sequence devised by the `Pygame library`. The `pygame.event` *module* knowns a number of event types, among which the `KEYDOWN` event, referring to the event that the user presses a key on the keyboard.

In the example above, several conditions have to be fulfilled so that the program state changes to `"prepare next trial"`: The current program state has to be `"welcome"`, the event has to be a `KEYDOWN`and the key pressed has to be `SPACE`. Note that in the program above, program termination can be achieved at any time through the `"quit"` state.

## Common errors

* Trying to make a `for` loop iterate over an *integer* instead of a *sequence*. Very often, you will want your program to modify all elements of a given sequence according to a set of statements. Logically, you will need as many iterations as elements in the sequence. This often leads to `for`statement definitions such as:
```{python error = TRUE}
myList = [1,2,3,4,5]
for i in len(myList):
    myList[i] += 1
```

Probably, your intention was to make the loop repeat as many times as there are elements in `myList`. However, `len(myList)` returns an *integer*, not a *sequence* object. Instead, you will have to convert the *length* of `myList` into a *sequence*, for instance by using `range()`.

```{python}
myList = [1,2,3,4,5]
for i in range(len(myList)):
    myList[i] += 1
  
print myList
```

* `index out of range` errors tend to slip in when working with loops

```{python error = TRUE}
myList = [range(10),[1,2,3]]

for i in range(len(myList[0])):
     myList[0][i] = 0
     myList[1][i] = 0

```

Always make sure that sequences you intend to modify in a `for` loop body actually have as many elements as the sequence over which you are iterating in the `for` statement.

## Debugging

1. Loops can (in theory) continue for an infinite amount of iterations. Imagine looping over a data set of more than 1000 experimental participants. Loops with a large amount of iterations may seem cumbersome to debug at first sight. Computers make mistakes when they are falsely instructed and they will make the same mistake over and over again, infinitely if they must. You can imagine that debugging a loop that runs over hundreds or thousands of iterations is a pain when each time you change a small piece of code you need to run all iterations before you can inspect the result of the change in code. Here, the `break` statement can be used to inspect the output your loop generates at a single, or a fixed amount of iterations. By doing so, you do not only save time because your program does not need to execute each iteration of the program, your output will also be less cluttered. Picture a piece of code that produces one printed line for each iteration of code, like so

```{python, eval=F}
for i in range(1000):
  print("Hello, World!")
```

Now you change a small part of the code and want to inspect its effect.

```{python, eval=F}
for i in range(1000):
  print("Hello " + "World" + "!")
```

It is unneccessary to print this one-liner a thousand times to see what is going on. Instead, you can use the break statement to print a single line.


```{python}
for i in range(1000):
  print("Hello " + "World" + "!")
  break
```

This comes in handy when you suspect a bug in one of your loops. Remember that if there is a bug in your loop, your computer will make the same mistake over and over again. So if you identify the bug in one iteration or a small amount of iterations, it will also be present in the exact same way in the remaining iterations. Usually, you can resolve bugs in your loops based on what you inspect in a subset of iterations.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1. Following the control flow

Read the script below carefully. Indicate the values of the following expressions after the script has finished executing:

```{python, eval=F}
dataset.keys()
dataset[dataset.keys()[0]]
condA[0]
condA[0][0]
len(condA)
len(condB)
meanA
meanB
```

You can check your answers afterwards by running the script.


```{python, eval=F}
import numpy as np

dataset = {'p1':(21,"Female","Dutch","B-Psychology"),
           'p2':(20,"Female","Dutch","B-Psychology"),
           'p3':(21,"Female","Dutch","B-Applied_Mathematics"),
           'p4':(23,"Male", "German","B-Communication_Science"),
           'p5':(20,"n/a","Dutch","M-Business_Administration"),
           'p6':(19,"Male","Swedish","B-Computer_Science"),
           'p7':(19,"Male","German","B-Communication_Science"),
           'p8':(24,"Female","Italian","M-Psychology"),
           'p9':(23,"Female","Italian","M-Communication_Science"),
           'p10':(18,"Male","Dutch","B-Computer_Science")
           }

condA = []
condB = []

ageA = []
ageB = []

for participant in dataset.keys():
    if dataset[participant][1] == "Female":
        condA.append(dataset[participant])
    elif dataset[participant][1] == "Male":
        condB.append(dataset[participant])

for participant in condA:
    ageA.append(participant[0])

count = 0
while count < len(condB):
    ageB.append(condB[count][0])
    count += 1
    
meanA = np.mean(ageA)
meanB = np.mean(ageB)
```


### Exercise 2. Debugging

The script below calculates some descriptives from `data`. The code is still somewhat buggy. Debug the script and indicate the values of `fastest`, `slowest`, and `all_mean`.

```{}
data = {'p1':(21,"Female","Condition B",[0.675,0.777,0.778,0.62,0.869]),
        'p2':(20,"Female","Condition A",[0.599,0.674,0.698,0.569,0.7]),
        'p3':(21,"Female","Condition A",[0.655,0.645,0.633,0.788,0.866]),
        'p4':(23,"Male", "Condition A",[0.721,0.701,0.743,0.682,0.654]),
        'p5':(20,"Male","Condition B",[0.721,0.701,0.743,0.682,0.654]),
        'p6':(19,"Male","Condition B",[0.711,0.534,0.637,0.702,0.633]),
        'p7':(19,"Male","Condition B",[0.687,0.657,0.766,0.788,0.621]),
        'p8':(24,"Female","Condition A",[0.666,0.591,0.607,0.704,0.59]),
        'p9':(23,"Female","Condition B",[0.728,0.544,0.671,0.689,0.644]),
        'p10':(18,"Male","Condition A",[0.788,0.599,0.621,0.599,0.623])
        }

fastest = ("initialization", 100)
for participant in data:
    RTsum = 0
    for i in len(data[participant][3]):
        RTsum += data[participant][3][i]
    RTmean = RTsum/len(data[participant][3])
    if RTmean < fastest[1]:
        fastest = (participant,RTmean)
        
slowest = ("initialization", 0)
for participant in data:
    RTsum = 0
    for RT in participant[3]:
        RTsum += RT
    RTmean = RTsum/len(data[participant][3])
    if RTmean > slowest[1]:
        slowest = (participant,RTmean)
        
all_mean = 0
all_sum = 0
number_of_trials = 0
for participant in data:
    counter = 0
    while counter < len(data[participant][3]):
        all_sum += data[participant][3][counter]
all_mean = all_sum/number_of_trials*len(data)
```

### Exercise 3. Nested loops

Nested data often requires *nested loops* for answering certain questions about the data. Let's have a look at the `list` data set below. each participant has a participant number paired with a list of additional experiment information.

```{python, eval=F}
participants = [
    ("p1", ["Condition 1","Location A","withdrew","no audio"]),
    ("p2", ["Condition 1","Location A","no audio","no video"]),
    ("p3", ["Condition 2","Location B"]),
    ("p4", ["Condition 1","Location A","withdrew"]),
    ("p5", ["Condition 2","Location A"]),
    ("p6", ["Condition 2","Location B","withdrew"]),
    ("p7", ["Condition 1","Location A","no video"]),
    ("p8", ["Condition 1","Location B"]),
    ("p9", ["Condition 2","Location B","withdrew"]),
    ("p10",["Condition 2","Location A","withdrew"])]

```

If we want to know how many participants withdrew their participation we need a counter, and for each participant we need a second loop that tests each of the experiment information in turn on the `"withdrew"` keyword:

```{python,eval=F}

counter = 0
for (participant, expInfo) in participants:
  pass
        # to be implemented by you
        
print("The number of participants who withdrew their participation is", counter)

```

Implement the second `for` loop that iterates over the experiment information and count the number of participants who withdrew their participation.

### Exercise 4. Data transformation using loops

* Write a script that transforms the data set `participants` from Exercise 3 into a dictonary data set.
* Extend the script with a `counter` mechanism that counts the number of participants who were tested at location A and location B respectively.

### Exercise 5. Calculating a mean

For the sequence `seq` calculate the arithmetic mean using a `while` loop. Check your implementation using the `mean()` method of the `NumPy` library.

```{python, eval=F}
import numpy as np

seq = range(1000)

```


### Exercise 6. A guessing game

Make a Python script `guessing.py` that implements the following behaviour:

* At the beginning of the script, a random number between 0 and 1000 is generated.
* The program continuously asks for user input prompting the user with the request to enter a number.
* If the user guesses the number correctly, the program gives feedback that the number was guessed correctly. The program also shows the number of guesses needed. Finally, the program terminates.
* If the guessed number is too large, the program gives feedback that the number is smaller.
* If the guessed number is too small, the program gives feedback that the number is larger.
* If no input is given, the program should terminate. In this case, the program should terminate if the given input is *empty*. *Hint:* Use the internet to figure out how to handle empty input.

*Hint*: Prompting and feedback via the console is sufficient.
