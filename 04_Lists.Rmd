# Lists {#lists}

```{python}
message = ["Hello,"]
message.append("world")
print(" ".join(message))
```

In chapter 2 Variables you encountered the four basic data types, *integers*, *floats*, *Strings* and *Booleans*. You also learned that apart from these four basic data types, Python knows numerous specialized types. In this chapter, you will learn more about one group of these specialized data types: *collections*.

## Lists

One type of collection are *lists*. Lists are *ordered* collections of values.

```{python, eval=F}
a = [5, 10, 15, 20]
b = ["eggs", "bacon", "cheese"]
c = [4, "participant", 7.3, False]
```

The easiest way of creating a list is surrounding some values with cornered brackets `[]` and separating the values of the list with commas `,`. The values that make up a list are called *items* or *elements*. In a sense, lists are similar to *Strings*. Strings are basically ordered collections of *characters*. In contrast to Strings, however, the elements of list can be of *any* type. Ordered collections such as strings and lists are also called *sequences*.

`[]` denotes a list with no elements and is called an *empty list*. Lists can even be *nested* into one another to form lists of lists!

```{python, eval=F}
a = []
b = [True, 2.0, "hello", [5,6]]
```

Elements of a list can be accessed using yet another type of operator, called the *index operator* `[]`.

```{python}
numbers = [3, 17, 8]
print(numbers[1])
```

The *expression* inside the brackets (in this case the integer `1`) specifies the *index* of the selected element. Each element inside a list has a unique index, an *integer* describing the element's position in the sequence. One major cause of errors surrounding lists is that indices start at `0`, not at `1`, as you might expect. This means that the first element of a list is accessed by indexing `0`, not `1`.

```{python}
myString = ["Hello", "World", "!"]
print(myString[0])
print(myString[2])
```

In contrast to Strings, lists are *mutable* sequences. This means that even after a variable is assigned a list value, specific elements of the list can be changed without reassigning a completely new list! You can use the *index operator* to change specific list items.
```{python}
shoppinglist = ["appels", "bananas", "tomatoes"]
print("Wait, I do not need tomatoes after all!")
shoppinglist[2] = "peaches"
print("Updated shopping list: " + ",".join(shoppinglist))
```

You can also access sublists in a list using *list slices*:
```{python}
myList = [1, "a", 2, "b", 3, "c"]
print(myList[:])
print(myList[0:2])
myList[0:2] = "d"
print(myList)
```

Note that the statement `myList[0:2] = d` mutates both items, `1` *and* `"a"` into a single new item `"d"`, not only changing the content of `myList`, but also its total number of items!

The `:` expression selects all elements of a list and can be used for *cloning*.

```{python}
myList = [1, "a", 2, "b", 3, "c"]
myCopy = myList[:]
print(myCopy)
```


By now, you have seen a few examples of class specific *functions*, such as `",".join(shoppinglist)` for the class `string`. Even though a detailed explanation of *functions* is postponed to Chapter \@ref(functions), a quick introduction to objects, classes, and class specific functions will help you make the best use of the class `list` and the class' useful built-in methods. For now, you can see functions as pieces of reusable code.

When you use a variable `myList` and assign a value to it, say `[4,5]`, you can think of it as creating an *object* (i.e. an instance) `myList` of *class* (i.e. type) *list*. A class can have pre-defined *methods*, that are *functions* that can be accessed and used by any *object* of the class. An example is the `append` method for the `list` class.

```{python}
myList = [4,5]
myList.append(6)
print(myList)
```

As you probably already figured, the `append` method adds the element specified between the brackets to the end of the list. Typing `help(list)` in your console will give you a complete list of built-in functions of the class `list` and what their functionalities are.

## Tuples

*Tuples* are an ordered collection of values, much like *lists*, but with less exentensive functionality and  their unique characteristic being that they are *immutable*. Once Python has created a *tuple* in memory, you cannot change its content.

```{}
thorndike = ("Edward", "Lee", "Thorndike", 1874, "Law of effect", "Law of exercise")
thorndike[4] = "Law of recency"

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

Tuples are usually used when one can assume that the collection of values will not change. They are *records* of related information, chunked together so that we can use it as a single entity.

However, if you really need to change the contents of an already existing tuple you can always make its variable name reference to a new tuple holding different information.

```{python}
thorndike = ("Edward", "Lee", "Thorndike", 1874, "Law of effect", "Law of exercise")
thorndike = thorndike[:] + ("Law of recency",)
print(thorndike)
```

Note the `,` in the second assignment statement. Without the comma at the end of the parentheses, Python treats the content of one-element tuples such as `("Law of recency",)` as a the data type of the element (in this case a `str`), resulting in a *type error* when trying to concatenate the `thorndike` tuple and `("Law of recency")`.

Python has a very powerful *tuple assignment* feature that allows a tuple of variable names on the left of the assignment operator `=` to be assigned values from a tuple on the right of the assignment operator. Thereby you can easily perform several variable assignments in just one line!

```{python}
thorndike = ("Edward", "Lee", "Thorndike", 1874, "Law of effect", "Law of exercise", "Law of recency")
(name, middle_name, surname, born, contribution1, contribution2, contribution3) = thorndike
print(contribution2)
```


## Dictionnaries

*Dictonnaries* share similarities with real-life address books where you can find a person's contact details by looking up his or her name.

```{python}
address_book = {"studyadviser-PSY": "studyadviser-psy@utwente.nl ",
                "studentservices" : "studentservices@utwente.nl",
                "ICT-helpdesk"   : "servicedesk-ict@utwente.nl"
                }

print(address_book["studyadviser-PSY"])
```


Dictionaries associate *keys* (e.g. a name) with *values* (e.g. contact details). The `key:value` pairs of a dictionnary are separated by commas. Each pair contains a *key* and a *value* separated by a colon `:`. `key:value` pairs are always one-to-one mappings. You can, of course, map a *key* to a *list* of multiple values. *Keys* are required to be immutable and unique within a dictionnary. This means that you cannot have two `"studyadviser-PSY"` keys in the `address_book`. Unlike sequence types, such as lists and tuples, the elements of a dictionnary are unorderded in the sense that they do not have indices that mark their position. Values contained in a dictionnary can solely be accessed through their *keys*.

Dictionnaries are mutable. You can modify the values of a dictionnary by accessing its associated key:

```{python}
address_book = {"studyadviser-PSY": "studyadviser-psy@utwente.nl ",
                "studentservices" : "studentservices@utwente.nl",
                "ICT-helpdesk"   : "servicedesk-ict@utwente.nl"
                }
                
address_book["studentservices"] = ("studentservices@utwente.nl", "0534892124")
print("The telephone number of the student services is", str(address_book["studentservices"][1]))
```

You can add entries and remove whole entries of a dictionnary using the `del` statement.

```{python}
address_book = {"studyadviser-PSY": "studyadviser-psy@utwente.nl ",
                "studentservices" : "studentservices@utwente.nl",
                "ICT-helpdesk"   : "servicedesk-ict@utwente.nl"
                }
                
address_book["studentUnion"] = "studentunion@union.utwente.nl"
print(address_book)
                
del address_book["ICT-helpdesk"]
print(address_book)
```


## Putting data structures to use

Lists, tuples and dictionnaries are used readily in programming interactive software, such as the Stroop experiment, to structure user data or structuring elements of the program in a computer's memory. Structuring user input makes later retrieval of information easier, for instance for the purpose of statistical analysis.

```{python, eval=F}
KEYS     = {"red": K_b,
            "green": K_n,
            "blue": K_m}
RT = []
STATE = "wait_for_response"

if STATE == "wait_for_response":
    if event.type == KEYDOWN and event.key in KEYS.values():
        time_when_reacted = time()
        this_reaction_time = time_when_reacted - time_when_presented
        RT.append(this_reaction_time)

```


## Common errors

* `index out of range` errors are among the most common programming errors made, even by experienced programmers.They typically occur if you try to access an element that does not exist in a sequence.

```{}
shoppinglist = ["milk", "eggs", "bread", "appels"]
print shoppinglist[4]

IndexError: list index out of range
```

Most of the time, this error will occur because you confused the starting index `0` with `1`. Remember that, for instance, in a list of four elements the last element is stored at index `3`, instead of at index `4`.
```{python}
shoppinglist = ["milk", "eggs", "bread", "appels"]
print(shoppinglist[3])
```

* Trying to change the content of a *tuple*. Tuples are immutable, meaning that you cannot change their content after their initialization. You can, however, re-assign the variable name of an existing tuple to a new tuple containing different information.

```{}
myTuple = (1,2,4)
myTuple[2] = 3

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

```{python}
myTuple = (1,2,4)
print(myTuple)
myTuple = (1,2,3)
print(myTuple)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1. Shopping list
```{python, eval=F}
shoppinglist = ["bread","cheese","jam","milk","oatmeal","blueberries","oranges","apples"]
shoppinglist[0] = "buns"
shoppinglist = shoppinglist + ["chocolate"]
del shoppinglist[2]

shoppinglist_mum = ["eggs","yoghurt","potatoes","salmon"]
shoppinglist += shoppinglist_mum
del shoppinglist[10]

ingredients_muffins = ["icing sugar","whipping cream","lemons","flower","vanilla sugar","eggs","mandarines","baking powder","sugar","margarine"]

shoppinglist.append(ingredients_muffins)
del shoppinglist[11][6]
shoppinglist[8:11] = [shoppinglist[8:11]]

del ingredients_muffins[7]
```

The above shopping list has been subject to several changes since it has been written. Standing in the supermarket, you want to know the contents of the final shopping list. Which groceries do you have to buy?

You can check your answer afterwards by running the code.

### Exercise 2. Dictionnaries

```{python, eval=F}
famous_psychologists = {"Freud":("Sigmund", "Freud", (1856,1939), "Psychoanalysis"),
                        "Piaget":("Jean", "Piaget", (1896,1980), "Theory of Cognitive Development"),
                        "Skinner":(("Burrhus", "Frederic"), "Skinner", (1904,1990), "Operant Conditioning"),
                        }
                      
erikson = ("Erik", "Erikson", (1902,1994), "Theory of Psychological Development")
famous_psychologists["Erikson"] = erikson

more_on_Skinner = {"Schedules of Reinforcement":("positive reinforcement", "negative reinforcement", "extinction"),
                   "Skinner Box":("pigeon","lever","food"),
                  }
famous_psychologists["Skinner"] = famous_psychologists["Skinner"][:3] + ("Behaviorism",) +         (famous_psychologists["Skinner"][3],) + (more_on_Skinner,)

```

Using the given dictionnary on famous psychologists and the above changes made to the dictionnary:

* Try to understand the changes made to the original dictionnary by writing down the content of the following print statements

```{python, eval=F}
print(famous_psychologists["Erikson"][:3])
print(famous_psychologists["Piaget"][3:])
print(famous_psychologists["Freud"][2][0])
print(famous_psychologists["Skinner"][0][1])
print(famous_psychologists["Skinner"][5].keys()[1])

word = famous_psychologists["Skinner"][5].keys()[0]
print(famous_psychologists["Skinner"][5][word][0])
```

* Afterwards, you may check your answers by running the code. Pay attention that your own answers match exactly.

### Exercise 3. Element selection

For the following data structures, give the code by which you can access the specified element.

```{python, eval=F}
dinner = ["minced beef", "tomatoes", "pasta", "onions", "pasta sauce", "courgette"]
shoppingList = [dinner, "bread", "milk", "cornflakes", "cheese"]
```

```{python,eval=F}
grades = {"p1": ("Judith",21,"female","B-PSY",(5.6,7.7,7.3)),
          "p2": ("Menno",19,"male","B-CREATE",(8.6,6.9,7.4)),
          "p3": ("Jan",19,"male","B-CREATE",(3.9,4.5,8.9)),
          "p4": ("Eva",20,"female","B-MATH",(8.0,7.0,9.1)),
          "p5": ("Sophia",22,"female","M-PSY",(4.9,6.7,7.6)),
          "p6": ("Jeroen",25,"male","M-BME",(8.5,8.5,8.5)),
          "p7": ("Max",18,"male","B-IBA",(7.9,2.0,6.5))
         }
```


1. `milk` in `shoppingList`
2. `minced beef` in `shoppingList`
3. The study of `Jan` in `grades`
4. The age of `Sophia` in `grades`
5. The name of participant 6 in `grades`
6. Judith's grade on the third partial exam in `grades`
7. The grade of participant 5 on the first partial exam in `grades`
8. The maximum grade achieved on the second partial exam


### Exercise 4. Adjust a dictionnary data set

The data set below originates from a (fictive) language course given at the University of Twente. During the course, the following information was stored about the participants: age, gender, nationality, study programme, for each lesson, whether the participant was present or not (`True` indicates presence during the lesson and `False` absence), and the paricipant's score on the final exam.

```{python, eval=F}
dataset = {'p1':[21,"Female","Dutch","B-Psychology",[True,False,True,False,False],5.2],
           'p2':[20,"Female","Dutch","B-Psychology",[True,True,True,False,True],8.4],
           'p3':[21,"Female","Dutch","B-Applied_Mathematics",[False,True,True,False,True],7.8],
           'p4':[23,"Male", "German","B-Communication_Science",[True,True,"n/a","n/a",True],8.8],
           'p5':["n/a","n/a","Dutch","M-Business_Administration",[False,False,True,True,True],7.6],
           'p6':[19,"Male","Swedish","B-Computer_Science",[True,False,False,True,False],7.5],
           'p7':[19,"Male","German","B-Communication_Science",[True,True,False,True,True],5.4]
           }
```
The lecturer has to perform some last minute changes to the data set before handing it in for statistical examination. Perform the following changes to the data set by accessing the relevant elements.

1. After taking a resit, participant 1 and participant 7 did pass the course. Participant 1 scored a 6.1 on the resit and participant 7 a 7.4.
2. Participant 5 forgot to put her age and gender on the registration form. Participant 5 is female and 23 years old.
3. The docent forgot to sign the presence of participant 4 during two lessons. Participant 4 was present during all lessons.
4. During the course, participant 2 changed her study programme from B-Psychology to B-Health Sciences.
5. After the final examination, it was revealed that participant 4 cheated during the exam. The examination board decided to void the student's achievements on the exam. In such a case, the additional note `expelled` is added to the student's record, indicating the student's misbehaviour.

### Exercise 5. A dictionnary data set

Fill in the participant information given in the table below in a Python dictionnary with the following structure:

```{python, eval=F}
participants = {participant_no:(gender, age, nationality, profession)}
```

Participant No.|Gender|Age|Nationality|Profession
-|-|-----|-------|------|----------
1|Male|19|Dutch|Student
2|Male|47|Dutch|Pharmacist
3|Male|31|Italian|PhD Student
4|Female|22|German|Student
5|Female|46|Dutch|Florist
6|Male|27|Dutch|Student
7|Female|22|Dutch|Police trainee
8|Female|26|Indian|Architect
9|Male|18|American|Student
10|Male|20|Chinese|Student

Using Python and by accessing the relevant elements in the dataset

1. Calculate the *average age* of the participants
2. Calculate the *standard deviation* of the age variable
3. Calculate the *maximum* and *minimum* of the age variable

*Hint*: Libraries provide built-in methods beyond the repertoire of the standard Python language. For instance, `NumPy` provides all kinds of methods for statistical operations in Python. You can import a library by typing `import (library name)` and make use of library-specific methods like this `(library name).(method)`. Take a look at the documentation of the `NumPy` library.

### Exercise 6. Stroop extension

In this exercise you will implement a conditional execution of the interactive Stroop program. Imagine that you want to examine whether the number of colors influences the reaction time of participants in the Stroop experiment. In particular, you have gathered ten participants whom you randomly assigned to either a three or a five word version of the Stroop task. The table below summarizes which participant is assigned to which condition.

Participant No.|Condition
-|-|
1|Stroop 3
2|Stroop 3
3|Stroop 5
4|Stroop 3
5|Stroop 5
6|Stroop 5
7|Stroop 5
8|Stroop 3
9|Stroop 5
10|Stroop 3

For this exercise, a modified version of the Stroop task is given. In `ch4ex6Stroop.py`, a rudimentary implementation of user console input is provided. In two additional `STATES`, the user enters his participant number and the entered number is stored for the rest of the program run. The modified script has a function `pickColor5()`, which implements the random selection of words and colors for the five-color version.

In order to implement the comparative Stroop version program (three vs. five colors) program, consider the following steps:

* Open `ch4ex6Stroop.py` and scan the changes to the original code. Try to understand the changes performed to the code.
* Incorporate the information contained in the table above on the condition assignment of the ten participants. Which data structure will you use for storing this information?
* Prepare the code for both Stroop task versions, a version with three words, three colors, and three buttons and the same for the five-word version. Choose any two additional colors.
* Think about which places in the program need to be adapted and which of them need adaptation depending on the condition.
