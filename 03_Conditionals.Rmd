# Conditionals {#conditionals}

```{python}
if 1 == 1:
  print('Hello World')
```

## Boolean logic

In Chapter 2 Variables, you read about simple *Boolean expressions* that produce *Boolean values* (`True`, `False`) with the help of *comparative operators* (`==`,`!=`,`>`,`<`,`>=`,`<=`). In this chapter, we will first take a closer look at Boolean expressions as we work towards introducing the main actor in regulating the flow of a computer program, *conditionals*. In chapter 1 [Introduction] you took a closer look at the Stroop Task program. You saw that the program shifts between different stages of the Stroop experiment, among which preparing a trial and waiting for the participant's response. These experimental stages are mirrored in the different *states* of the Stroop Task program. A simple lamp, for example, can be regarded as having two possible states, namely being either switched *on* or *off*. The Stroop Task program knows more states than simply being switched on or off, but just as a simple lamp, it needs some kind of switch to transit from one state to another. This is were *conditionals* come in handy as you will see at the end of this chapter. But first things first, let's take a look at the following two examples:

```{python, echo=TRUE}
print(10 > 5 and 5 > 2)
```


```{python}
print(True or False)
print(True and not False)
print(not True and False)
```

`and`, `or`, and `not` are the three *logical operators* used in Python. They allow us to build more complex Boolean expressions from simpler ones. Sometimes these operators confuse people because they are used differently in informal language. Therefore, it is important to understand what they formally mean in Python (and math and all other programming languages). The following *truth table* displays what these operators exactly mean for two variables `a` and `b` for all combinations of values:

a|b|not a|a and b|a or b|not a or b
-|-|-----|-------|------|----------
True|True|False|True|True|True
True|False|False|False|True|False
False|True|True|False|True|True
False|False|True|False|False|True

There exists a set of rules for working with Boolean values, much like highschool mathematical algebra. First of all, the logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` differ in their priority. In highschool, you learned that given a formula `a + b * c`, you first multiply `b` and `c` before adding `a`. This is the same as saying that `*` has a higher *precedence* than `+`. From highest to lowest the precedence ranking for the three logical operators is: `not`, `and`, `or`. In addition, the six *comparative* operators (`==`,`!=`,`>`,`<`,`>=`,`<=`) precede all logical operators.

```{python}
print(not True or 1 == 1)
```

Also notice that

```{python}
print(not True and False)
```
is not the same as

```{python}
print(not (True and False))
```

As in mathematics, brackets can be used to change the order of operations! 

## if ... then {#if-then}

Boolean values are essential for regulating the flow of a computer program as they provide the conditions under which certain blocks of code are executed. The simplest form of a *conditional* is the *if statement*.

```{python}
myNumber = 0
if (myNumber < 0):
    print("myNumber is smaller than 0")
if (myNumber >= 0):
    print("myNumber is larger than, or equal to 0")
```
You can read *if statements* as

> If whatever is written within the curved brackets equals `True`,    
> then, and only then, the intended (from intendation, not intention!) code within the statement is evaluated.

An `if statement` consists of a *header* and a *body*. The header begins with the *keyword* `if`, followed by a *Boolean expression* (the *condition*) and ends with a colon (`:`). The brackets around the condition are optional, but recommended to facilitate readability. Only if the given condition in the *head* is met, the program will read and execute the code written in the statement's *body*. Note that Python requires that the statements written in the body of an `if statement` are indended consistently (commonly by four spaces). The intended statements are called a *block* and the first unintended statement designates the end of the block. The usefulness of intendation may at first not be apparent to you, but trust me, it facilitates reading complex programs enormously.

Actually, you can simplify the code above by using an *else clause*:

```{python}
myNumber = 0
if (myNumber < 0):
    print("myNumber is smaller than 0")
else:
    print("myNumber is larger than, or equal to 0")
```

*else clauses* are optional, but they often simplify your code. If you need to establish a dichotomy, that is, either condition A is `True` or not, then you using an `if/else clause` is the way to go. More complex conditional structures can lead to *nested* conditionals:

```{python}
myNumber = 0
if (myNumber < 0):
    print("myNumber is smaller than 0")
else:
    if (myNumber == 0):
        print("myNumber equals 0")
    else:
        print("myNumber is larger than 0")

```
The indentation makes the structure of the program visible. However, most of the time, nested conditionals complicate your code unecessarily, making it more difficult to read. It is commonly regarded as good practice to keep the usage of nested conditionals to a minimum.

But then, you may ask yourself, how do you implement more than two execution branches, without resorting to nested conditionals? Let's pretend that it is incredibly important to your program that it does make a difference between the case that `myNumber` is larger than 0, compared to when `myNumber` equals 0.

```{python}
myNumber = 0
if (myNumber < 0):
    print("myNumber is smaller than 0")
elif (myNumber == 0):
    print("myNumber equals 0")
else:
    print("myNumber is larger than 0")
```

The *elif statement* (short for `else if statement`) allows you to include more than two alternative conditions. In theory, you can build an endless chain of alternative conditions using `elif`. Whether it is useful to do so, is, of course, a different question. Whenever `elif` is included in a train of conditions, the whole structure is called a *chained conditional*. Note that when using an *else clause* in a chain of conditionals, it always marks the end of the chain. Furthermore, each condition is checked in order. If the first is `False`, the next is checked, and so on. Note that only the first `True` branch is executed, even if more than one condition is `True`. There is nothing like "more true" in Boolean logic.

```{python}
myNumber = 1
if (myNumber >= 0):
    print("myNumber is greater than or equals 0")
elif (myNumber == 1):
    print("myNumber equals 1")
else:
    print("myNumber is smaller than 0")
```


Alternatively, *nesting* can often be circumvented by using *logical operators*:

```{python, eval=F}
myNumber = 5
if (myNumber > -5):
    if (myNumber >= 0):
        print("myNumber is a positive digit")
```

```{python, eval=F}
myNumber = 5
if (myNumber > -5 and myNumber >= 0):
    print("myNumber is a positive digit")
```

## Bringing interaction to life: Conditional state transitions

In programming interactive software, such as the Stroop experiment, conditionals are essential to control the flow of the program. By controlling the *flow*, we mean how the program changes states in reaction to the input of the user. Without the programmer's intervention, a program is executed from top to bottom. You can imagine that the Stroop Task program needs to be more flexible than that, depending on the actions of the participant. Take a closer look at how the Stroop Task program transits from the welcome screen to the first trial:


```{python eval = FALSE}
STATE = "welcome"    

if STATE == "welcome":
    if event.type == KEYDOWN and event.key == K_SPACE:
        STATE = "prepare_next_trial"
        print(STATE)
```

In plain English, this would be the same as telling the program to switch from state `"welcome"` to state `"prepare_next_trial"` upon pressing the `SPACE` key. To see this in action, run the Stroop Task program, and watch closely what is printed to the console. You will see that whenever the program transits into a new state, the state of the program is printed to the console.

### Transition tables

In the previous section, you saw how conditionals regulate the flow of a computer program. Depending on specific user actions, the state of the program transits into another state. When you first encounter the code of an interactive program such as the Stroop Task program, writing out all possible state transitions in a *transition table* helps to understand the structure of the program. A transition table lists all states against each other in a table and documents how the program transits from one state to another. The empty transition table for the Stroop Task program is shown below.

|	|	| welcome |	present_trial |	wait_for_response |	feedback | goodbye | quit |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|FROM |welcome           |	 |	 |	 |	 |   |   |   |   |
|	  |present_trial     |	 |	 |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|	  |wait_for_response |	 |	 |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|	  |feedback          |	 |	 |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|     |goodbye           |	 |	 |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|     |quit              |	 |	 |   |   |   |   |   |   |

By taking a close look at how the Stroop Task program transits from one state to another, the transition table can be filled in. The changing state part of the Stroop Task program is displayed below, together with the completed transition table for the Stroop Task program.


```{python, eval=FALSE}
KEYS     = {"red": K_b,
            "green": K_n,
            "blue": K_m}
            
# Changing states
for event in pygame.event.get():                        
    if STATE == "welcome":
        if event.type == KEYDOWN and event.key == K_SPACE:
            STATE = "present_trial"
            print(STATE)
                    
    if STATE == "present_trial":
        trial_number = trial_number + 1
        this_word  = pick_color()
        this_color = pick_color()
        time_when_presented = time()
        STATE = "wait_for_response"
        print(STATE)
                    
    if STATE == "wait_for_response":
        if event.type == KEYDOWN and event.key in KEYS.values():
            time_when_reacted = time()
            this_reaction_time = time_when_reacted - time_when_presented
            this_correctness = (event.key == KEYS[this_color])
            STATE = "feedback"
            print(STATE)

                
    if STATE == "feedback":
        if event.type == KEYDOWN and event.key == K_SPACE:
            if trial_number < 20:
                STATE = "present_trial"
            else:
                STATE = "goodbye"
            print(STATE)
            
    if event.type == QUIT:
        STATE = "quit"
```

|	|	| welcome |	present_trial |	wait_for_response |	feedback | goodbye | quit |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|FROM |welcome           |	 |SPACE	 |	 |	 |   |   |   |   |
|	  |present_trial     |	 |	 |auto   |   |   |   |   |   |
|	  |wait_for_response |	 |	 |   |b OR n OR m   |   |   |   |   |
|	  |feedback          |	 |SPACE	 |   |   |SPACE  |   |   |   |
|     |goodbye           |	 |	 |   |   |   |   |   |QUIT   |
|     |quit              |	 |	 |   |   |   |   |   |   |

The transition from state `present_trial` to state `wait_for_response` occurs automatically once all preparations for the trial are finished. Generally, we distinguish between two types of transitions, *interactive changes* (ITC) and *automatic changes* (ATC). While an input from the user is required in interactive state transitions, the program changes from one state to another on its own in automatic transitions. It is generally a good idea to separate ITCs from ATCs in your code to make the structure of your program more apparent.

Apart from understanding another's code, transition tables are also useful when you conceive your own program. They serve as an interaction skeleton to which you gradually add functionality as you develop your program.

### State charts

State charts are another tool for representing the interaction of a program. They are especially useful for developing your own programs. State charts serve as a blueprint. They depict the basic structure of your program to which you gradually add functionality. It helps to keep the basic functionality in sight while developing. You can easily get lost in small, optional features while the basic structure of your program is still unfinished. Below you see a state chart of the interaction in the Stroop Task program. States are shown as squares and conditions as diamonds. Arrows indicate the flow of the program, their labels give more information about state transition changes. Note how the state transition from `present_trial` to `wait_for_response` has no label. When you look into the code of the Stroop Task program, you will notice that the transition between these states is automatic with no further condition to be fulfilled.

## Common errors

1. Confusing the *assignment operator* (`=`) with the comparative *equals operator* (`==`).

```{}
myNumber = 5
if (myNumber = 5):
    print("Yes, myNumber is indeed equal to 5!")

SytnaxError: invalid sytnax
```

Yes, confusing the assignment operator with the comparative equals operator will be a re-occuring issue. For human beings it is just too easy to type `=` when they actually mean `==` in Python. Being a psychologist, go figure.

2. The most common syntax error involving *conditionals* is probably forgetting the colon at the end of the *head* of the `if statement`.

```{}
if (1 == 1)
    print("Hello, World!")
```

Whenever you encounter a syntax error in your conditionals, you should first check whether you forgot a colon.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
if (1 == 1):
    print("Hello, World!")
```

3. Exclusively using `if clauses` in a chain of conditionals. This is a tricky one because the consequences may not immediately be apparent. Plus, no error is necessarily thrown. Still, you program somehow does not do what you expect it to do. In truth, exclusively using `if clauses` is not wrong in itself; but chances are high that you intended to use a chain of `if/elif clauses` instead. Let's take a look at the following two code snippets to illustrate the difference between a chain of `if clauses` and a chain of `if/elif clauses`.

```{python}
number = 6
if (number % 2 == 0):
    print("number is divisible by 2")
elif (number % 3 == 0):
    print("number is divisible by 3")
elif (number % 6 == 0):
    print("number is divisible by 6")
else:
    print("number is not divisible by 2, 3 or 6")
```

```{python}
number = 6
if (number % 2 == 0):
    print("number is divisible by 2")
if (number % 3 == 0):
    print("number is divisible by 3")
if (number % 6 == 0):
    print("number is divisible by 6")
else:
    print("number is not divisible by 2, 3 or 6")
```
As you can see, in the first code snippet, only the first `True` conditional branch is executed, although `6` is obviously not only divisible by `2`, but also by `3` and `6`. In the second code snippet, however, all `True` conditions are executed consecutively. Why is that?
Well, in the first code snippet we are dealing with one single `if statement` or conditional with several subclauses ( the `elif` and `else` clauses), while the second code snippet strictly speaking consists of three individual `if statements`. These three conditionals are independent from each other and as such, are executed independently from each other. The first code snippet is read as "if `number` modulo 2 equals 0 (which is the same as saying 'if `number` is divisible by 2'), then print this or that; however, if (and only if) `number` is not divisible by 2, then look for a different `True` condition". In contrast, the second code snippet reads as "if `number` is divisible by 2, print this or that. Full stop. If `number` is divisible by 3, print this or that. Full stop. If `number` is divisible by 6, print this, else print that". In a chain of `if clauses` the individual clauses are disconnected, which is why they are read as a summation of individual clauses rather than one coherent statement.

You may ask yourself why this is included in the *Common errors* section. After all, using exclusively `if clauses` is not necessarily "wrong". The problem is that exclusively using `if clauses` may do the job at the beginning of your programming career, but it is a source for complex errors at a later stage. Remember to use chains of `if/elif/else clauses` whenever you want to need to make sure that only one `True` condition is executed at a time.

4. Using `tabs` and `spaces` interchangably to indent your code. To be honest, your Python compiler may not complain immediately when you mix `tabs` and `spaces`. However, there are good reasons why you do not want to do this anyway:

1. Usually the human reader has even more difficulty than the computer discerning block structures when mixing `tabs` and `spaces`. This makes subsequent programming efforts a quite error-prone activity. For example, you are more likely to make indentation errors when you use `tabs` and `spaces` carelessly. And believe me, your Python compiler will throw an error at any of those!
2. The semantics of tabs are not very well defined in the computer world. As a result, tabs may be displayed completely differently on different types of systems and editors. This means that you cannot safely transfer your code without risking to destroy your program's structure.

More information on indentation in Python can be found [here](http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/block_indentation.hawk).

## Debugging conditionals

In addition to some general good debugging practices summarized in chapter 9 [Debugging], there are some strategies that are especially useful when dealing with errors originating from conditionals in your program.

1. Again, checking your assignment `=` and equals `==` operators is a good starting point when trying to debug errors you suspect to originate from your conditionals. Using an assignment `=` operator where an equals `==` operator is needed will throw a syntax error and vice versa. While you are busy checking your assignment and equals operators, also check whether you forgot any colons `:` at the end of the first line of your if statements. This will also throw a syntax error.

2. Take a good look at the *conditions* in your if statements. You can check a variety of *conditions* interactively in your Python console outside of the program. Check whether the Boolean expression in your condition does indeed evaluate as you expect it to. There a countless reasons why it may not evaluate as you intended. The variables you include in your condition may have unexpected values. You should then track down how they were assigned their respective values. Also check the precedence of your operators when you use several in one expression.

3. Check if you can simplify your conditionals. The more complex your conditionals, the more prone you are to making mistakes. Simplifying deeply nested conditionals can solve programming errors that are otherwise difficult to track down.

        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()
```


### Exercise 1. Following the control flow

Read the following program code and try to follow its control flow. Write down the content of each `print statement`. Check your answers with the help of your python editor. *Hint*: spaces also add to the length of a string (as measured by the `len()` *method*)!

```{python, eval=F}
myString = "Hello, World!"
if len(myString) >= 13 or "ello" in myString:
    myString = "Hi, programming aspirant!"
elif len(myString) <= 12 and "ello" in myString:
    myString = "Hello, from the other side."
print myString

if "Hi" in myString:
    if len(myString) < 25:
        myString = "Wow, my computer seems to answer!"
    elif len(myString) > 25:
        myString = myString + " -- Your computer"
    else:
        myString = myString + " How are you?"
else:
    if len(myString) <= 29:
        myString = "How are you, my computer?"
    elif len(myString) == 27 and "Hello" in myString:
        myString = myString + " I must have called a thousand times."
    else:
        myString = myString + " -- Adele"
print myString

if "computer" in myString or len(myString) == 38 or "HI" in myString:
    myString = myString + " I myself am doing fine."
else:
    myString = myString + " I am doing just fine."
print myString
```

### Exercise 2. Indentation

Copy the following piece of code and run it. Correct all indentation errors until the code runs error-free.
```{}
myNumber = 4
if myNumber < 20 and myNumber > 0:
    if myNumber > 0 and myNumber < 15:
    myNumber = myNumber + 3
    else:
       myNumber = myNumber - 3
        print "This is a dead end statement."
elif myNumber > 20:
print "This should only be printed if myNumber exceeds 20!"
else:
    myNumber = 17
```


### Exercise 3. Pseudo code conditionals

Translate the following common language sentences into *pseudo code* conditionals as in

* If it rains tomorrow, I will take an umbrella with me.

```{}
if rain
    set umbrella to True
```
Pseudo code is a programming language-independent informal and simplified description of the essential operating principles of a computer program. It adheres to the structural conventions of a normal programming language, but it is rather meant for the human reader than machine reading. Pseudo code is commonly used for sketching out the structure of a computer program before the actual code writing takes place. You can find a more detailed description of what pseudo code is and some examples of written pseudo code [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode).

1. If there is no *rain* tomorrow, I will either go *swimming*, if Jan has time to join that is, or I will go *hiking*. Otherwise I will stay at home and *read*.
2. Under the condition that the participant is *18 years or older* and has *no history of alcohol abuse*, he or she *may participate* in our study.
3. When the streets are *wet*, the chance is high that it has *rained*.
4. If the participant turns out to be *eligible* to participate *brief* him or her about the experiment. Otherwise kindly *explain* that they do not meet the criteria to participate. If the eligible participant is assigned to *condition A*, lead them to *room 001*. If he or she is assigned to *condition B*, lead them to room *002*.

### Exercise 4. Modify Stroop Task

Add a conditional to the interactive Stroop experiment so that in case the participant's reaction time exceeds 5 milliseconds, "Come on, you can be faster!" is printed to the screen

Hints:

* First think about where in the program you need to make changes to print the message

* Formulate the `if statement` or mutate existing `if statements` to fit your needs

* Use the existing program code as a template for drawing the message

### Exercise 5. Simplify nested conditionals

For a research project, you want to examine to what extent gender affects the influence of coffee on a person's performance on a vigilance task. You perform matching during sampling. All females will be grouped together, and all males will form one condition.

The code below represents a decision tree that matches a candidate participant on the basis of their personal details with either condition A (for females) or condition B (for males). In addition, the decision tree raises a warning if the candidate does not meet at least one of the requirements for participation.

As is, the code is quite complex, including a lot of redundant lines and unneccessary nested conditionals. First, read the code carefully to figure out the requirements a candidate participant has to meet in order to participate in the study. Then, simplify the code while maintaining its functionality.

```{python, eval=F}
### participant details ###
age = 20
gender = "Male"
study = "Psychology"
speaks_Dutch = True
coffee = True
condition = "not eligible for the experiment"

if age >= 18:
    
    if gender == "Female":
        if study == "Communication Sciences":
            if speaks_Dutch == True:
                if coffee == True:
                    condition = "A"
                elif coffee == False:
                    print "Participant is not eligible to take part in the experiment."                   
            elif speaks_Dutch == False:
                print "Participant is not eligible to take part in the experiment."
                
        elif study == "Psychology":
            if speaks_Dutch == True:
                if coffee == True:
                    condition = "A"
                elif coffee == False:
                    print "Participant is not eligible to take part in the experiment."                   
            elif speaks_Dutch == False:
                print "Participant is not eligible to take part in the experiment."
        
        elif study != "Communication Sciences" and study != "Psychology":
             print "Participant is not eligible to take part in the experiment."
                    
    elif gender == "Male":
        if study == "Communication Sciences":
            if speaks_Dutch == True:
                if coffee == True:
                    condition = "B"
                elif coffee == False:
                    print "Participant is not eligible to take part in the experiment."                   
            elif speaks_Dutch == False:
                print "Participant is not eligible to take part in the experiment."
                
        elif study == "Psychology":
            if speaks_Dutch == True:
                if coffee == True:
                    condition = "B"
                elif coffee == False:
                    print "Participant is not eligible to take part in the experiment."                   
            elif speaks_Dutch == False:
                print "Participant is not eligible to take part in the experiment."
                
        elif study != "Communication Sciences" and study != "Psychology":
            print "Participant is not eligible to take part in the experiment."
else:
    print "Participant is not eligible to take part in the experiment."

```
